# Super Tic Tac Toe AI

My own AI implementation for super tic tac toe. Currently it does not work. I plan to create a [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) implementation before I endeavor to make a fully-fledged neural network, [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)-style.

The end goal is to get a computer engine as powerful as [Stockfish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockfish_(chess)>). We should be able to analyze the best moves, worst moves, and figure out why. We should be able to categorize moves from "brilliant" to "blunder."
